                            <p>We chose the Boathouse at Rockett's Landing for our ceremony and reception venue for several reasons. The view of the city is amazing, we love the water, the food is always fantastic,and instead of coordination all of the little things such as linens, a caterer, servers, bartenders, chairs, tables, etc., it's all there wrapped into one! This was especially important to me, and made the planning process easy.</p>

                            <h3>All-Inclusive</h3>
                            <p>We were looking for a venue that was "very Richmond." Our first time visiting it, and seeing the view and how it would look being married with the James River and city skyline as our backdrop, we were sold. The fact that the packages are all inclusive made it so easy. Everything was so beautiful, so elegant, and just perfect. It really was our perfect day, and I wouldn't change a thing.</p>

                            <p>Using The Boathouse as our venue cut down the amount of vendors we had to coordinate as well as they handle the tables, chairs, linens, dance floor, bar, and catering. The rehearsal and wedding/reception went super smoothly and neither my husband, my mom, or my mother in law had to worry about the thing. Highly recommend this venue!</p>
